# Data project
##### Created by: nx31

The data project contains a Jupyter Notebook, dataProject.ipynb 

This data project examines the employment changes, by looking at the workforce distribution in Denmark, from Q1 2009 and until Q4 2018. 
It contains a data analysis of the employment, in both the private and public sector over this period. It tries to explain the fluctuations, using known events and changes to policies, over this period. We will also include both stationary and interactive plots to better visualize the changes of the employment over this periode.

Requirements:
PyDST Package, can be downloaded by writing - pip install pydst.
Just make sure you have internet connetion :)

Best regards, nx31.
