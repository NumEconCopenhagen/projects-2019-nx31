# Dataproject
#### Created by: XHT111 and NVC347

The dataproject contains a Jupyter Notebook, dataProject.ipynb 
## WE DO NOT USE THE FOLDER dataproject, but did not wan't to delete it.

This dataproject examines the employment changes, by looking at the workforce distribution in Denmark, from Q1 2009 and until Q4 2018. 
It contains a data analysis of the employment, in both the private and public sector over this period. It tries to explain the fluctuations, using known events and changes to policies, over this period. We will also include both stationary and interactive plots to better visualize the changes of the employment over this periode.

In 2008 we were hit by one of the longest lasting financial crisis in modern times. In 2010 we see the lowest private employment in the period, but also the largest public sector in history. The private employment is close to 1.3 million employees, almost 300.000 lower than the peak before the crises of 1.6 million. On the other hand the government increased the workforce by almost 50.000 from 810k to 860k employees in just 2 years. This was done to lessen the economic impact of the crises. From 2010 the private employment slowly grows and the public employment slowly returns to its normal level. From 2010 and up, the private employment has been slowly growing, likely because of the loose economic politics in this periode.
