# Dataproject
##### Created by: Michael Emcken (XHT111) and Thomas HÃ¸gh Scheel (NVC347)

The data project contains a Jupyter Notebook, NX31_Data_Project.ipynb


The dataproject examines the employment changes in Denmark from Q1 2009 and until Q4 2018. 
It contains a data analysis of the employment in both private and public sector over this period and tries to explain the fluctuations.
Lastly we will include both stationary and interactive plots to better visualize the changes of the employment over this periode.

The notebook runs, using only the packages stated in the packages section.
Just make sure you have internet connetion :)

Best regards, NX31.

PS. Happy coding friend !
