# Modelproject
##### Created by: Michael Emcken (XHT111) and Thomas HÃ¸gh Scheel (NVC347)

The modelproject contains a Jupyter Notebook, NX31_Model_Project.ipynb

In the latest decades, there has been a tendency that there are fewer young people in the working generation and relatively more individuals in the elderly, retired generation. We are going to define this tendency as the burden of the elderly.
This modelproject will try to examine this burden and model it, using the OLG model. We will compare different versions of the model, starting with solving the general model and then the PAYG version. After this, we will compare the 2 models to see which has the highest steady state capital, and compare their transisition.

The notebook runs, using only the packages stated in the packages section.
Just make sure you have internet connetion :)

Best regards, NX31.

PS. Happy coding friend!
