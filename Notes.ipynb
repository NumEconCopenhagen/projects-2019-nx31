    "It is very nice that you start your analysis out with an outline of what you are going to do throughout the analysis. In cell 5 I would prefer if you just created a dictionary with the keys you are going to use. I am aware that Anders showed you this way in the lectures. Good that you rename your columns to more understandable names in your analysis. I think you could have spend a bit more time on your analysis. It is very high level. You state that the growth in number of public employees is due to to the growth in the number of employees. I would be interesting if you had calculated the change in the number of employees. You could also decompose the growth at the different sectors. Very good work with the layout of your figure. Especially, the formatting of the axis. Please let me know if you have questions to my comments. "
